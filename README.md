# BillBot
My personal Python-based bot for Discord. 

# Overview
This bot is designed for personal use in Discord servers that I have power in.

I originally created this bot to learn the basics of Python and to learn more about Discord in general.

I plan on adding more to it throughout the year.  

#Cogs
Each cog has functions that the bot can perform. 

##admin
The 'admin' cog contains moderation functions of discord. Currently deletes messages. 

##dnd
The 'dnd' cog contains a dice roller and two functions that grabs character potraits on demand. 

##lol
The 'lol' cog only contains quotes of the champion Pantheon. I plan adding more features using riots API in the future.

##misc 
The 'misc' cog contains my first few functions that I have used to become more familiar with Discord.py and Python.
